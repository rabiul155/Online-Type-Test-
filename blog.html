                localStorage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a new tab,
                or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.
                sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab or the
                browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and new
                storage.

            </h3>
            <p class="text-white p-5 block-card">
                The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the block statements (e.g. if
                conditions or for loops), don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because
                the variables are still in the same scope. ES6 introduced block scope by using the let and const
                keywords

            </h3>
            <p class="text-white p-5 block-card">
                The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack
                is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
                which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

            <h3 class=" text-center text-white ">how many ways to get an undefined in javascript?
            </h3>
            <p class="text-white p-5 block-card">
                An undefined variable or anything without a value will always return "undefined" in JavaScript. This is
                not the same as null, despite the fact that both imply an empty <br>
                When a variable is declared or initialized but no value is assigned to it, JavaScript automatically
                displays "undefined" <br>
                lso, when you try accessing values in, for example, an array or object that doesn’t exist, it will throw
                undefined.
